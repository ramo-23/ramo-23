## About

My work is centered on data science, with a practical skill set that naturally carries across analytics and data engineering.

I focus on solving real data problems end‑to‑end: framing questions, exploring and cleaning data, engineering features, building and evaluating models, and communicating results clearly.

My software background still shows up — but mainly as an advantage. I use engineering practices to make data work **reproducible, structured, and closer to production**, rather than as an end in itself.

*I care less about titles and more about whether the analysis actually helps someone decide.*

## What I Do

* Exploratory data analysis & feature engineering
* Predictive modeling and forecasting
* End-to-end workflows from raw data to insights
* Clear analytical communication through visuals and narratives

## Tools I Reach For

**Languages & Tools**
Python · SQL · Pandas · Polars · DuckDB · Streamlit

**Analytics & Modeling**
Statistical analysis · Business analytics · scikit-learn · Model evaluation

**Data Engineering (foundational)**
ETL concepts · Data validation · Reproducible pipelines

## Current Threads

* Stronger data engineering fundamentals (ETL, storage, orchestration concepts)
* More realistic datasets and business-style problem framing
* Improving project documentation and analytical storytelling

---

## Interests

* Practical data science over theory-heavy work
* Forecasting, time-series, and business-facing models
* Bridging analytics and engineering without over-specializing

---

## Collaboration

* Data analytics / junior data science roles
* Data-focused side projects
* Collaborative learning environments
